# About

I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at the University of Essex, where I share my time between the [Department of Sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology) and the [Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk). At ISER, I am a member of the [ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC)](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/misoc). I also hold a Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers at the [Berlin Institute for Integration and Migration Research](https://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/en/welcome), awarded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral Researcher at the [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch) at ETH Zürich between 2015 and 2021. From 2017, I was Principal Investigator of the project "Who Succeeds and Who Fails? A Multilevel Social Network Analysis Approach to Immigrants’ Psychological and Sociocultural Adaption in Europe" (Computational Social Science Grant, awarded by the Volkswagen foundation). Between 2015 and 2017, I served as a project for the [Swiss StudentLife Study](https://sn.ethz.ch/research/studentlife.html) administered at ETH. I received my PhD from the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk) and [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford in 2016. My supervisors were Tom Snijders and Janne Jonsson.

My work aims at understanding social inequalities along immigrant background, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and gender. I study how social processes in the education system reinforce or counteract systematic differences between groups of students. Much of my work applies state-of-art dynamic social network models.
